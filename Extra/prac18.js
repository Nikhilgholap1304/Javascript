const marks = {
  section1: { alpha: 15, beta: 16 },
  section2: { alpha: -31, beta: 19 }
};
const { section1: { alpha: alpha1, beta: beta1 } } = marks; 
//remember we are destructuring and assigning the keys to const keyword

// console.log(section1) //error
// console.log(section ,alpha) //ReferenceError: section is not defined

console.log(alpha1, beta1); //15,16


//lets trace it what's happening

//first we take whole thing inside curly braces like a key and the object reference to the opposite end
//so section1 which is present as a key in the marks object
//by using ":" we are trying to rename
//think of it as a whole variable (i.e section1)
//so now we are trying to again destructure this section1 which consist of an object like we have done for marks
//so alpha, beta are the keys which are again present inside of the section1 object
//and we are renaming those nested object keys by alpha1 and beta1
//so the conclusion is we have done nested destructuring and only the node/child keys happening to be renamed can be accesed
