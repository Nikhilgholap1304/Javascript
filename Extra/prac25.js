// Async and Await

// There’s a special syntax to work with promises in a more comfortable fashion, called “async/await”. It’s surprisingly easy to understand and use.

async function f() {
  return 1
}

console.log(f())
//Promise { 1 }
//All the way till now despite doing many projects you have been having no idea about this, how lame
