// Prototype

// String, Array, Function

// The prototype of string, array and function is object and the prototype of object is null

// function demo(n){
//   return n
// }

// surprise, we can also treat function as an object
// what inheritance does is we can use all the behaviour of functions as well as we can use the member/methods/functionalities of objects as well cuz the prototype of function is also an object


// demo.name = "nikhil"
// console.log(demo(1))
// //1

// console.log(demo.name)
// //demo

// console.log(demo.prototype)
// //{}

// console.log(demo.constructor)
//[Function: Function]


function createUser(username, score){
  this.username = username
  this.score = score
  // return this
}

createUser.prototype.increment = function(){
  this.score++
}

createUser.prototype.printMe = function(){
  console.log(this.username)
}

// const gojo = createUser("gojo", 20)
// const yami = createUser("yami", 30)
// console.log(gojo, yami)

const gojo = new createUser("gojo", 20)
const yami = new createUser("yami", 30)
// console.log(gojo.prototype.printMe())
//error

//literally what "new" does is; it creates the whole 

// gojo.printMe()
//gojo
// console.log(yami)
// createUser { username: 'gojo', score: 20 }
// createUser { username: 'yami', score: 30 }



//if you don't use "new" then "this" keyword will refer to an global object which has rest of the common details, not the specific one and will override the previous values 

// gojo.printMe()
//TypeError: gojo.printMe is not a function
//if we try to access the prototype method without using "new" keyword
//but 

// createUser.prototype.printMe = function(){
//   console.log("yoo")
// }
// createUser.prototype.printMe()
// if we try to call that newly added printMe method through its object/function itself then it works

//so new objects can be created with a constructor function, like new createUser(). and then only you can access that property/method added through function

// If createUser.prototype is an object, then the new operator uses it to set [[Prototype]] for the new object.

//JavaScript had prototypal inheritance from the beginning. It was one of the core features of the language

// Please note that createUser.prototype here means a regular property named "prototype" on createUser. It sounds something similar to the term “prototype”, but here we really mean a regular property with this name

console.log(createUser.prototype.constructor === createUser)
//The default "prototype" is an object with the only property constructor that points back to the function itself
//true
console.log(gojo.constructor === createUser)
//true

//We can use constructor property to create a new object using the same constructor as the existing one
const naruto = new gojo.constructor('naruto', 40)
console.log(naruto)
//createUser { username: 'naruto', score: 40 }
//surprise - That’s handy when we have an object, don’t know which constructor was used for it (e.g. it comes from a 3rd party library), and we need to create another one of the same kind




/*

Here's what happens behind the scenes when the new keyword is used:

A new object is created: The new keyword initiates the creation of a new JavaScript object.

A prototype is linked: The newly created object gets linked to the prototype property of the constructor function. This means that it has access to properties and methods defined on the constructor's prototype.

The constructor is called: The constructor function is called with the specified arguments and this is bound to the newly created object. If no explicit return value is specified from the constructor, JavaScript assumes this, the newly created object, to be the intended return value.

The new object is returned: After the constructor function has been called, if it doesn't return a non-primitive value (object, array, function, etc.), the newly created object is returned.

// Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype. The prototype is itself an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype, making what's called a prototype chain. The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has null for its own prototype.

//The property of an object that points to its prototype is called prototype

// When you try to access a property of an object: if the property can't be found in the object itself, the prototype is searched for the property. If the property still can't be found, then the prototype's prototype is searched, and so on until either the property is found, or the end of the chain is reached, in which case undefined is returned

// This is an object called Object.prototype, and it is the most basic prototype, that all objects have by default. The prototype of Object.prototype is null, so it's at the end of the prototype chain

//actually whatever new property or method we are creating or assigning to the function/class via prototype is then gets added inside the prototype object as a property or method which is again inside of constructor function/object 

//but theres no need to mention constructor object as it implicitely happens

// function f2(){}

// const fObj = new f2()
// now the [[prototype]] object gets created for fObj and can be able to inherit all the functions properties which was inside the org functions constructor object/function
